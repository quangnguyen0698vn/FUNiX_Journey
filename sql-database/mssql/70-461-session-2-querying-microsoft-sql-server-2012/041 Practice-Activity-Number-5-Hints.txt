1. Use the + to join together two strings.














2. The letter Ⱥ is not an ASCII character, and [name] is a VARCHAR, not an NVARCHAR. So what can you do?














3. To do this, you need to use SUBSTRING.















4. How long is the string? Need to use LEN.
