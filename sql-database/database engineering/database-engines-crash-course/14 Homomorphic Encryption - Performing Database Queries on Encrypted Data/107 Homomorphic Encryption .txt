Symmetric Encryption
Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

Why we can’t always encrypt
Database Queries can only be performed on plain text 
Analysis, Indexing, tuning
Applications must read data to process it 
TLS Termination Layer 7 Reverse Proxies and Load Balancing


Meet Homomorphic Encryption!
Ability to perform arithmetic operations on encrypted data
No need to decrypt! 
You can query a database that is encrypted! 
Layer 7 Reverse Proxies don’t have to terminate TLS, can route traffic based on rules without decrypting traffic 
Databases can index and optimize without decrypting data
