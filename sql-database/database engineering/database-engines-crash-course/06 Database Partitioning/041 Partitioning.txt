CUSTOMERS Table
SELECT Name

WHERE ID = 700,001

What is Partitioning?
Which “partition” is customer 700,001  in?
Partition CUSTOMERS_800K

SELECT Name 
FROM CUSTOMERS_TABLE
WHERE ID = 700,001

Split 1 million rows table into 5 tables called partitions.. Same schema

Vertical vs Horizontal Partitioning 
Horizontal Partitioning splits rows into partitions
Range or list
Vertical partitioning splits columns partitions 
Large column (blob) that you can store in a slow access drive in its own tablespace

Partitioning Types
By Range
Dates, ids (e.g. by logdate or customerid from to)
By List
Discrete values (e.g. states CA, AL, etc.) or zip codes
By Hash
Hash functions (consistent hashing)

Horizontal Partitioning vs Sharding
HP splits big table into multiple tables in the same database, client is agnostic
Sharding splits big table into multiple tables across multiple database servers
HP table name changes (or schema)
Sharding everything is the same but server changes

Demo - Example with Postgres 
Spin up a postgres instance
create a table and Insert 10 million rows
Create partitions

Pros of Partitioning
Improves query performance when accessing a single partition
Sequential scan vs scattered index scan
Easy bulk loading (attach partition)
Archive old data that are barely accessed into cheap storage

Cons of Partitioning
Updates that move rows from a partition to another (slow or fail sometimes)
Inefficient queries could accidently scan all partitions resulting in slower performance
Schema changes can be challenging (DBMS could manage it though)
